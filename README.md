# The-X-Files

*What is it for?* As a prosperous club like OpenMind, there seems not a proper public space to store good things for its members. For example, there is no a book display board showing whether a book is popular exclusively among its members.  
So in the first plan, we will implement a book display board to tell its members all the books that have been recommanded among members, and which of them are most popular.

This is just the beginning. we wish there will be other features that let members to share, to observe, to play around. What are these features? They are top secret now, that is why this is called the-x-files. Eng heng!
